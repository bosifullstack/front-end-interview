# Luma Front End Engineering Interview

## Felipe Azevedo Bosi Test

## Assumptions or project decisions

I decided to use css-in-js since I was suggested to use Material-UI in the project. I also used a date-picker on the birth-date input to get a better UI for the user.

One of my assumptions was that the backend would receive only one patient per POST request.

## What I would have done differently, if I've had more time

- TypeScript. I've never used TypeScript on a React project, so I still don't know enough about it to use it with proficiency;
- Redux, if the project were bigger and have more features;
- Because of the time constrain, I didn't made the shape of the data received on the state of the main view equivalent to the shape contained of the dataShape file. however, I know the importance of treating the data that we get on the front-end before sending it to the back-end;
- Better commits and commit messages. Because of the constrain, I didn't commit on the right other neither wrote the better commit messages that could made it easier to understand the steps that I made thought the development of the project.
