## Assumptions or project decisions

Based on my previous experiences, I prefer to start a project using the Sass CSS pre-processor. Its features allows the CSS project to be better organized, facilitating the project stylesheets to grow freely.

## What I would have done differently, if I've had more time

- TypeScript. I've never used TypeScript on a React project, so I still don't know enough about it to use it with proficiency;
- React hooks. I'm still used to use class based component, since first I learn to write components based on a class api in React and in Vue.js.
